4/17/2025 10:22:05,6,Used VR more than 5 times,2,4,2,4,4,Kinda,I think it would depend entirely on what the VR controls are like. If it was the same controls I don't think I would do any better.

If it was 3d that would be different.,5,Sometimes,"I've never played tetris in VR but I have played a 3D puzzle type game in VR as well as outside of VR, and the VR environment was way more immersive and it was so much easier to use the VR controls to move around and beat the puzzle."
